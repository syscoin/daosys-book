# Security

When a DAO joins the DAOSYS ecosystem it will be either verified or unverified, which is a security attribute that will dictate the way it conducts itself on the network. This verification is done automatically and trustlessly based on the configurations it adopts upon launch. Within that classification, it will be further subclassed as either private or public. Hence, the four types of security are: public verified, private verified, public unverified, and private unverified.

### Verified DAOs

The main purpose of verified DAOs is to ensure that contributing DAOs are safe to transact with from a security standpoint, as DAOSYS will know what contracts will be doing with storage and will be participating in the tokenomics model described in Section V. The public verified usecase will be the most common type of DAO on the network and are essentially clones of DAOSYS. With this comes the ability to create is own sub-network of child DAOs where it will receive the benefit of cascading royalties as illustrated in Fig. 5. The freedoms on launching a public verified DAO would akin to the GNU public licence in the sense that there would be certain freedoms that users would be permitted and not permitted to do with the source code.

A private verified DAO would be the second most adopted usecase on the network having freedoms akin to a Redhat or AWS EC2 licence agreement where participation in the DAO is free, but services and support are not. A likely scenario of this would be corporations looking to set up private smart wallets to consume the DAOSYS features.

### Unverified DAOs

When a newly launched DAO contains facets augmented to configurations that do not adhere to the DAOSYS standards, then it is classified as unverified. For users that are not proficient in Solidity development and security then there is an increased risk that users of unverified DAOs could loose their funds. However, that does not mean that there are not good usecases for these types of DAOs. For instance, a public unverified DAO may be used as a public testnet to vet new ideas that are uncommon to the network. Whereas a private unverified DAO may be useful to those looking setup smart wallets with modules consisting of a host of sophisticated asset managing DeFi strategies. These modules will allow users to configure their own DeFi strategies and would be akin to players in traditional finance setting up their own LLCs to manage funds.
